# Side View Metrics

Metrics collections and analysis plan for Side View as part of the [Firefox Test Pilot program](https://testpilot.firefox.com).

## Analysis

Data collected in this experiment will be used to answer the following high-level questions:

* How often do users load a non-homepage in the sidebar?
* Are people who use Side View heavy tab users?



## Collection
Data will be collected with Google Analytics and follow [Test Pilot standards](https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/docs/experiments/ga.md) for reporting.

## Custom Metrics
*none*

### Custom Dimensions

* `cd1` - The width of the sidebar in pixels.  An integer, rounded to the nearest 50px.
* `cd2` - The number of open tabs across all windows.  An integer
* `cd3` - The site type requested.  One of `desktop` or `mobile`
* `cd4` - The length of the list the user interacted with.  Used for open and recent tab lists.  An integer
* `cd5` - The index of the link in the list on the homepage.  Used for open and recent tab lists.  An integer

### Events

#### Startup / errors

##### When add-on starts up (browser restart or new installation)

Called each time the add-on starts up

```
ec: startup,
ea: startup,
ni: true
```

Note `ni` (not-interactive) will keep these events from being grouped under user activity.

##### When a link cannot be added to Recent Tabs

```
ec: interface
ea: fail-recent-tab
el: bookmark or link
```

Both bookmarks and links cannot be added to Recent Tabs; this event fires this situation occurs.
